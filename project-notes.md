## Deployment

The project is configured for deployment using Coolify and Nixpacks. Nixpacks automatically detects the project's framework and builds the application without requiring a Dockerfile. 
NOT need a yml file in the repo for deployment given we are using Coolify’s GitHub integration. Coolify manages the pipeline itself.
