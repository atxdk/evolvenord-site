# PPC Optimization: 10 Ways to Lower Costs and Increase Conversions

Running PPC campaigns that actually deliver ROI requires constant optimization. Here are 10 proven tactics to improve performance and reduce wasted spend.

## 1. Refine Your Keyword Strategy

Keywords drive everything in PPC. Optimize them regularly:

### Use Negative Keywords Aggressively

Negative keywords prevent wasted spend on irrelevant searches:

- Review search term reports weekly
- Add irrelevant terms as negatives
- Create negative keyword lists by theme
- Apply at campaign and ad group level

**Example**: Selling premium software? Add negatives like "free," "cheap," "cracked," "download."

### Focus on Long-Tail Keywords

Long-tail keywords often deliver better ROI:

- Lower competition = lower CPCs
- Higher intent = better conversion rates
- More specific matching = less waste

**Instead of**: "marketing software"  
**Try**: "email marketing software for small business"

### Match Type Strategy

Use the right match types:

- **Exact match**: Highest control, lowest reach
- **Phrase match**: Balanced control and reach
- **Broad match**: Maximum reach, requires careful monitoring

**Pro tip**: Start narrow (exact/phrase), then expand carefully.

## 2. Improve Quality Score

Quality Score directly impacts your CPC and ad position:
